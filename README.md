# 🚀 Churn Prediction

A modern analytics project using SQL Server, Power BI, and Python to uncover insights in customer data, visualize retention patterns, and predict which users are likely to leave—all in one place.

---

## Overview

- **Data Preparation:** Imported and cleaned customer data in SQL Server, staged for analytics, and built key views for analysis.
- **Data Exploration:** Profiled users and revenue, segmented customer attributes, and handled missing values using SQL and Power Query.
- **Dashboards:** Built interactive Power BI reports on customer segments, account activity, service usage, and business trends.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Applied a Random Forest model in Python to forecast customer churn, achieving high accuracy and highlighting key factors.
